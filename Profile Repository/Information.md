I would like to inform you that I have only been able to archive my current profile page, as my previous ones were lost to time and cannot be retrieved, even by site admins. I would also like to inform you that my only source on my Join Date is an old wiki page I made for myself, and could not get confirmation of its validity from the admins, so it may be somewhat inaccurate.
