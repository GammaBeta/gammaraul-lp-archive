Before I start off, I would like to clarify a couple of things: First, in case you're wondering, the 'Server Names' are just the file names which the server uses to identify files, which for some reason are different from the actual file name. Second, though the files in this folder are all savd as PNG, those are not their original file extensions, and were only saved as such to preserve image quality, and this ddocument will refer to them by their original file names. Third, there are some images which were deleted, and I sadly cannot retrieve them. With all that said, let us begin.
