**Additional Comments by Current Me:** The contrubutors translates to 'Made by Raul'. There's not much to say, it's just a somewhat standard level, though I think entering the pipe is meant to simulate the Pipe Cannon from Super Mario World. Apparently I had written the contents for a message box (which roughly translate to 'Here is your prize for surviving my tomfoolery') but I never used it.
