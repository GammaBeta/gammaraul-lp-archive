Excellent work with the level design, but I'm not sure if many of the obstacles are either nigh impossible or are just... difficult but possible to get through. Either way, I think this level deserves a perfect rating <br>

Good level, I love this theme you got going on. though the fire is a troll along with the bullet bills. but they are easy to avoid after that. have a 98 <br>
