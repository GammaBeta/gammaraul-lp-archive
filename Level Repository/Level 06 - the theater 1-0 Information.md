**Additional Comments by Current Me:** Once again, GammaRaul tries to plagiarize way better things; Not the worst level I've ever played, though I've certainly played better ones; I believe it was meant to have a Custom Background, but that got lost to time apparently. I have no idea why I marked it as 1-0 and not 1-1, but oh well.
