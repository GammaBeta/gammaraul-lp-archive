I like the several paths in the level, however there was no scenery and the gameplay was rather boring <br>
Easy <br>

This level was weak, it was just a game of luck. I'm gonna give this level a 5 out of 100!

5/100 (Easy) <br>

Interesting, but unfortunately I can't really award the level with a good rating seeing as not much is going on. I suppose I could give you a few points for the one galoomba challenge, but that was essentially the only thing it had to offer. The tiling was also decent, at least. Overall it ain't much of a playable level with the little it offered. Everything else I needed to say has already been said by everyone below. Shorter levels are definitely needed from time to time, but uh... this ain't it, chief. <br>

The only positive things I can input in your level are the good tile placement some scenery in the level. However, judging from your level that you had ten maps in use, it felt extremely short and there's only one galoomba to take care of in this level. You might want to start over with a clean slate and build a much longer level than that. No offense, but the effort should have been a lot better than that.

Nonexistent, but the goal post-looking things probably counted, and anything else would've ruined it <br>
(+2)

---Tiling--- <br>
Good I guess? <br>
(+2)

Going through pipes and other weird warps............ <br>

Too short and kinda lacking in challengings tbh :D <br>
(-35)

Difficulty: Easy, but I guess that was the point :) <br>

So, pretty interesting concept. It might have been kinda short, it may have had some flaws, but it was pretty funny to look at. In other words it was a funny level to look at, between slightly interesting and slightly boring to play, but kinda bad in other matters. Like, it had no challenges, and almost no scenery, but at least nice use of the map feature. I'm gonna give it a 60 (I originally gave 50 because of the layer two glitch, but since it was fixed I increased it) and an easy difficulty. <br>
