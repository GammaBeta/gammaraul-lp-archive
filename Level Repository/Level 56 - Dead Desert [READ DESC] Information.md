**Description:**  Mario has gotten the task of exploring the hottest desert on Earth to study the desert's history. <br>
This Desert is so hot that it has formed lava from molten rocks, many have tried to survive a certain amount of time there, but only a few came out alive. <br>
Mario has to be quick if he doesn't end up like the others. <br>
Oh, and don't mind all the bricks laying around, they're just the heated up clay of the Desert.

**Additional Comments by Current Me:** My first ever SMC level (that I saved, at least), and while it's unfinished, I did make a omewhat resectbale amount compared to mye other levels, also apparently NESFilipGamer was involved in the creation of this? Anyways, it appears as if, despite nowing how to add custom ongs to SMF games, I didn't know how to do that with SMC, and that's why I left the link in the description; Either that or the link I used for the song in the level expired, I don't remember.
