**Description:** fazendo pixel arts <br>
**Contributors:** feito por raul <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** The description translates to 'Making Pixel Art,' with a typo, of course, and the contributors once again translates to 'Made by Raul.' I remember making this level and though it's janky, the pixel art is good enough for the limitations of the game and foor a 7-year-old, though I thought I made more art pieces than just one.
