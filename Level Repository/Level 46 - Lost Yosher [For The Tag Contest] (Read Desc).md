Okay so, for some reason I had saved Lost Yosher twice on my account, as Level 43 and as Level 6, and I have no idea why that happened, but unlike Chef√µes da Vida, while the level code is the same, the Information is just different enough for me to think of it warranting a compromise (plus 60 Levels is a nice round number); I will make an Information file for it, but instead of a level code file, I will make a file with a notice telling people about this whole conundrum, which you are reading right now.
