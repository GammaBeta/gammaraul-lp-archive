**Description:**  This Is A Remake Of IggyHop's Deleted Level "Cake 4.5", Which I Reuploaded

Also, Sorry If This Is A Short And Bad Level, But I Tried To Be Quick Before Someone Made Cake 5, Maybe Beetween W2 And W3 Will Be Longer And Better (In Fact, This Was Lauched In The Same Day As Cake 5)

Also, This Is A Remake Of An Deleted IggyHop Level Which I Reuploaded But Deleted So I Can Get A Higher Average Level Score, Well, That One Didnt Do Anything With The Story Of W2 <br>
**Contributors:** No additional contributors. <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I have nothing to say about this except that it was extremely rushed, though I do find it funny how I considered this a 'Remake' of Iggyhope's level despite the fact that this doesn't look anything like their level.
