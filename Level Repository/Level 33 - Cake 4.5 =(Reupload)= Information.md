Fun fact: the level is actually possible. <br>
Also sorry for making terrible 3d pixel art, but it's not my fault. <br>

**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I have nothing much to say, except that for some reason I put a thumbbnail on this one too, though it's the same thumbnail as the next level, so I haven't bothered uploading it for this one as uploading the same thumbnail two times is redundant.
