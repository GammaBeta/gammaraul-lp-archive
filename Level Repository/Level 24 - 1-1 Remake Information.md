**Description:** Oh, Great, Another Remake, But This One Is A Bit Different... <br>
**Contributors:** Raul <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I actually like this level, I like the idea of a 1-1 remakke that's not quite all it seems (and 1-2 being a sub-world is a cool idea); I may actually make a level like this for Level Share Square (the successor to LP), though I'll obviously do some things differently.
