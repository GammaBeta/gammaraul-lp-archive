**Additional Comments by Current Me:** The name of the level translates to 'Bosses of Life,' albeit with a typo, and the contributors once again translates to 'Made by Raul.' This level is a bit of an anomaly, as I have two different copies of it save, but unlike with raul adventure 1-1, they are exactly the same, being posted only 3 seconds apart, either because of a site error or because I somehow managed to save it twice in the span of 3 seconds.
