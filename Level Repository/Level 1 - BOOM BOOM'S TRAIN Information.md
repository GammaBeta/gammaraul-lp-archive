Game: Super Mario Bros 2. (I meant to put Super Mario Flash 2, but got confused)

Difficulty: Easy (Perhaps it was bumped down by the ratings, or perhaaps I didn't set it correctly, either way it's weird that it's set as easy when, if my memory serves me right, I had trouble with the level.)

Additional Comments by Current Me: This was the first level I ever uploaded to LP, and I made it in a few hours, I also wasn't really that skilled at the editor so it's kind of jank; I originally wanted to make something similar to Luigibonus' Theater levels, even going as far as to copy the setup exactly at the start, but I didn't figure out how to make it, so I turned into a train.
