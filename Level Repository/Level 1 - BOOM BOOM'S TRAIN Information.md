**Game:** Super Mario Bros 2 (I meant to put Super Mario Flash 2, but got confused. Not to be confused with the Nintendo Entartainment System game with the same name.) <br>
**Game ID:** 2 <br>
**Difficulty:** Easy (Perhaps it was bumped down by the ratings, or perhaps I didn't set it correctly, either way it's weird that it's set as easy when, if my memory serves me right, I had trouble with the level.) <br>

**Description:** THATS HARD NOT TOO FOR THE PROS <br>
**Contributors:** ADVENTURE IN THE BOOM BOOM'S TRAIN (My old self must've thought this section was a second description.) <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This was the first level I ever uploaded to LP, and I made it in a few hours, I also wasn't really that skilled at the editor so it's kind of jank; I originally wanted to make something similar to Luigibonus' Theater levels, even going as far as to copy the setup exactly at the start, but I didn't figure out how to make it, so I turned it into a train.
