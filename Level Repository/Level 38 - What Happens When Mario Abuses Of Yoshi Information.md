**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I barely even started this one, and it also has the White Background issue I mentioned in the last level. I should probably mention that it is on this third era that I really began going ADHD mode, making levels and never finishing them left and right like it was nobody's business, having made 14ish unfinished/barely started levels at the peak. You'll see what I mean soon enough.
