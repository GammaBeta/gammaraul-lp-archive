As a way to say farewell to Flash, I and others have created this level as a way to give the platform a proper funeral.

**Additional Comments by Current Me:** You already know the deal with the redacted links (hopefully), so I can't be bothered to explain it again. Anyways, this is a Farewell collab level we made for Flash, as it was being removed from LP prior to it's official EOL, and it was this EOL which made it so that this level is a Kaizo Plateau Situation (Missing CBG), a Lost Yosher Situation (Missing Custom Music), and a Crafty Adventur Stiation (Lost Hack, uses the same hack as Sunday Afternoon), though as I'm writing this, I figured out how to solve that last one, and will provide a solution soon enough, just let me finish this repo, okay?
As for the level itself, it is sadly unfinished, with only two sections being either finished or having a decent length, including, surprisingly enough, my section; I like the gameplay of both sections (thanks, me!), and I like how my sextion looks like (aw, you're so kind), and I do wish that the entire collab was finished, as Flash deserves a better Farewell Level than an unfinished collab.
