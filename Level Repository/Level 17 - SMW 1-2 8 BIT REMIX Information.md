**Additional Comments by Current Me:** On a night on the 12th of October 2016, GammaRaul decided that he was tired of being a weak-willed pathetic little loser, and decided he wanted to go beyond; Instead of remaking SMB 1-2 in Super Mario World style, Ã§ole pther weak-willed pathetic little loser he decided he would remake SMW 1-2 in Super Mario Bros style instead! In all seriousness, though, I'm actually quite proud of this level, remaking Mario levels in the style of old Mario Game is a concept I don't think I've ever seen be done before, and I think it's a cool concept; This level is also one of the few from this era I remember making; Speaking of eras, I believe this level marks the end of my first era on LP, as I would later take my first significant hiatus from the site, likely because I forgot it existed.
