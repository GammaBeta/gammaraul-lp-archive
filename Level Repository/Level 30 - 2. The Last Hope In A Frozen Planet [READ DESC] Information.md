**Additional Comments by Current Me:** The original level, as was saved on LP, had the layer priorities mixed up, but I fixed that on for your convenience. Honestly, I don't really think of this as a worthy sequel to A Little Ice, maybe it's because it's unfinished, but something about it just doesn't click with me as being a sequel, y'know? A tad disappointing for my 30th level, ut at least the next one will be my second ever published level to not be deleted! Also, this is the first level I made to have a thumbnail, hence the image I added.
