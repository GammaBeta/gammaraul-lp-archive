**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually kind of proud of this one, it's undeniably bad, like all my other levels from this period were, but there's just something sweet about this one; I should also clarify that I never published these levels because of something I believe was called a Rating Intensive, where in an attempt to get users to rate more levels, the site stopped people from publishing their levels until enough rates were made; Thankfully you could still save your levels without publishing them, but since I was young and stupid, I believed that people could see my levels anyway, I just had to give them the link.
