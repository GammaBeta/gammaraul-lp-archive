**Additional Comments by Current Me:** You already know the deal with the redacted links, anyways, that's right, not only is this a Crafty Adventure situation, but also a Raul Adventure situation, and the reason why I think this happened is because I must've accidentally published the previous one, deleted it, then re-saved it, which is why I have two separate copies, and why the saving time for this one is very close to the publishing time of the last one. As for the level itself, I added a little more to it, and while it's not even halfway finished, I do wish I had finished it, because this one has potential.
