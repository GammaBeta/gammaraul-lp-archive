**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This is it, the final level, and to end things off with a bang, it's a bit of an anomaly. If you play it, it seems like it's a bit of a weird, barely started level, but if you look deeper into it by opening it in the editor, you will find that there are two much better, way more developed maps that, for some reason, I decided to put aside, but it gets weirder because when I tried to make an alternate version of the level where those two maps are accessible, I guess that map 4 had priority, because it merely not having an entrance point was enough to cause the level to not want to start up, and when I tried to delete it to see if that would solve things, but I couldn't delete the level for some fucking reason. Anyways, as for the gameplay, the accessible maps are barely started, and the inaccessible ones are longer and more traditional. <br>
Anyways, it's been a wild ride, when I first started this project I thought it wouldn't take any more than a week or two, but here I am, a little over a month later, dangerously close to the deadline, and only now I'm finishing this, mostly because there were days where I just couldn't be bothered, and it's been kind of stressful, but honestly, it's also been kind of fun to play and archive my stuff, but though I have archived all of my levels, there's still a little bit more I want to do that involves archiving my profile, which I will do tomorrow as of the time of writing, see you there.
