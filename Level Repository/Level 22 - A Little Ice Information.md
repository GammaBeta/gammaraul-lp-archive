**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This is it, my first ever level that I didn't delete later down the line, and for good reason, because while it has its flaws, it's actually quite good, with me having put 2 or 3 weeks of effort into it, something at the time unprecedented, which something I can truly be proud of. Because it's still up, the reviews are also still up, which I will also archive in a file of their own. <br>
It's the first thing I think of when it comes to the levels I made in the site, and funnily enough, I remember that one time, while I was hard at work at making this level, my parents asked me if I know how babies are born. I have no further comment about the level, I shall let it speak for itself.
