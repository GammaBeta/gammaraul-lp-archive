**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I have redacted the link as the site it linked to has shut down, though sadly the hack has gone down with it, so you'll have to play it in regular SMF2 instead. Anyways, while it was started, I did make a little bit, but not much; I think I had accidentally published it lol.
