**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I haven't redacted the link as the site is still up and still contains the Hack i used (Super Mario Flash 2 Hammer Mairo Edition), you will need to mess around with inspect element to get the file itself... Or just go [here](https://yoloswfhub.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/8/6/118614474/yolo25.swf), though I am unsure what I will do with both of these links when i manage to get an archive of my own going, we'll see. As for the level itself, I did make a little bit of it, though just a little, but I wish I had done more given how aesthetically pleasing it is. Anyhow, this level marks the end of my short yet packed third era on LP, as I once again forgot about the site after making this, though from now on, my activity on the site will be a lot more spotty, eeven if all the remaining levels are still part of the same era. <br>
Edit: Okay, so, while I didn't go on a forgetfulness hiatus after making this level (I had mixed things up because I only published the next level, Cake 8, in January of 2019), I will not be retracting the statement that this marks the end of my third era, because I am stubborn like that and refuse to change that about myself (/j).
