**Additional Comments by Current Me:** Strange, I could've sworn I made this level on my birthday, oh well, it's only 1 day off anyhow. About the level itself, yes, I did start a sequel to a level I would later delete, and yes, I did only make 4 rooms, and to be honest, I'm sad I didn't finish this level, because not only do I like the concept, but it's a lot better than the original, and has a lot more potential.
