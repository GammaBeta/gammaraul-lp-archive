**Additional Comments by Current Me:** I only made 3 rooms for this, a shame, I would've liked to see where it went; Perhaps I will give this concept another shot? Anyway, it is on this level where my second era on LP comes to a close, as after this one I once again forgot about the site for an extended period of time.
