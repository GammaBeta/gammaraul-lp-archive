**Description:**  Just A Simple Level To Announce My Return

Also, I Know It Is Bad And Short, I Mean, It Is Only A Test Level Inspired By A Video I Watched A Few Days Ago, I Am Not Deleting It Tho <br>
**Contributors:** No additional contributors. <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** 'I Am Not Deleting It Tho' I said, before deleting it. This level actully kind of jumpscared me, as not only are the 'stat's (for lack of a better term) of the level more accurate, but whether it be by pure luck or because of a site update, all of the reviews are still up. As for the level itself, it's nothing to write home about, it's just a kind of janky level trying to replicate those 'Non-Euclidean Physics' videos in the SMF2 Engine.
