**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This is another level I made that's meant to be 'Kaizo' but isn't quite there because I don't know how to make or play Kaizo, and I barely even started it. In case you're wondering why I called it a 'Plateau,' that's because another user had a series of 'Plateau' levels, I even distinctly remember asking said user if i could dall my level this. If you're playing on a Flash file get an error message telling you that it stopped a potentially dangerous process while loading the level and the level background is white, I think that's because Flash gave a false positive for dangerous stuff in the CUstom Background i used; I sadly don't know how to fix this.
