**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This level is a Tribute to a user called DeadFesh388, which I barely even started, and honestly, no offense to DeadFesh, they haven't done anything wrong as far as I'm aware, but the level doesn't really have potential in my eyes, and I find the premise lacking; If I ever made a  tribute to them nowadays, I would've done something different.
