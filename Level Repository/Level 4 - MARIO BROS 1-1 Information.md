**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This is just a 1-1 remake, and apparently I wanted to make the entire game; That would've been just a waste. I do wonder why the description says 8% though, probably because I was 7 and stupid, though at least I finally figured out that the Contributors part was for it seems.
