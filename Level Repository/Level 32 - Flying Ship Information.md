**Contributors:** No additional contributors. <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This one also had the layer priorities messed up, though that doesn't wquite matter, given how it was barely even started, this is becoming a worrying trend. Also, if you haven't noticed, this was meant to be a remake of Boom Boom's Train.
