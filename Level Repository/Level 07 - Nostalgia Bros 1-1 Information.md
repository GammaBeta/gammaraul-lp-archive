**Description:** Voltando para os anos 1000 <br>
**Contributors:** feito por Ruru <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** The description translates to 'Returning to the 1000s' (No idea where I got that from) and the contributors translates to 'feito for Ruru,' Ruru being a nickname my Grandma gave me; I appreciate the wack-ass level design this has going for it, but I don't have much to say apart from that.
