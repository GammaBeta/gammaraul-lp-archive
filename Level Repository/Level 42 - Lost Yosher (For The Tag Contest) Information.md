**Description:** Fun fact:  Me And Deadfish's Entry For The Tag Contest

Deadfish's Part: From 0x To 3740x <br>
My Part: From 4060x To 7280 <br>
**Contributors:** No additional contributors. (What were you smoking, 9-year-old me?) <br>
**Additional Comments by Current Me:** This is a quite tough, non-linear level I and Fesh made for a Collab Contest, and it's quite good, even if it was too hard for me, but I have to wonder, why did I delete it? It seems like a perfectly presentble level for the tag. Is there something I'm forgetting? I'll have to ask Fesh later.
