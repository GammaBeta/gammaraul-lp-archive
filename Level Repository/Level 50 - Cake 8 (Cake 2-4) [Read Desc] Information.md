**Additional Comments by Current Me:** Finally, the 10th Level Curse has been broken, as not only is this level one I finished and published, but also one that's actually pretty good! Of course, it is xtremely hard, and not even I, the creator, can beat it, though I'm sure it's possible as I tested it out chunk by chunk when I was making it. I actually remember making this one, there being a time when I was making this level while it was storming outside and I was watching memes, good times. Anyway, I sadly don't have much else to easy, except that I think my younger self really liked the orange castle bricks, as I made 3 levels that have them as part of the theme. I do wonder why I took so long to finish and publish this though. Also, I'm not sure what's up with the whole 'Big Mario can't jump into 2-block tall gaps' thing, I swear that didn't happen back when I made this.
