Since the Mario Fangame Level-Sharing platform called 'Level Palace' is being shut down soon, I have decided to archive the levels I made for it, both published and unpublished, here in Github, and provide details about them.

Good night, LP.

I wish to stress that, while each file's name starts with 'Level Number,' there is no recommended order to play these in, that the original lvel names don't include that, and that it's only there to organize the levels from oldest to newest instead of in alphabetical order.
