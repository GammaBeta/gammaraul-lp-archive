Since the Mario Fangame Level-Sharing platform called 'Level Palace' is being shut down soon, I have decided to archive the levels I made for it, both published and unpublished (alongside some extra stuff), here in Github, and provide details about them. I've been in this community since 2016, when I was 7 (around half my life as I'm 14 as of writing this), and though it's exciting to see it evolve once more, it is a shame to see Level Palace shut down, given how many memories I've made with it. Good night, LP.

I wish to stress that, while each file's name starts with 'Level [Number]' or 'Image [Number],' there is no recommended order to play or view these in, that the original level and image names don't include that, and that it's only there to organize the levels and images from oldest to newest instead of in alphabetical order. I also wish to clarify that I am using the MM/DD/YYYY format for dates, as I reckon most of my audience will be from the US.

You can download the flash games listed in the files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_PlWVJay8K2IOlQsFd7KDIey-AOPdTNH) and play the other games listed [here](https://luigibonus.com/)

If you are reading this, then this repository is still under construction.
